### An introduction,

I am Fatima and I have been testing software since 2005, when I got a job with an independent testing company straight out of college. I have worked in India, UK, Ireland, and USA, interacting with a wide variety of people, team structures, and work cultures.

In 2020, I worked on teams as a freelance tester for a short while. This was a great opportunity for me to take up my work with a greater oversight on how to test (process, tools) with minimal direction, and to hone my own testing knowledge.

I have worked in Functional Testing projects for the complete testing lifecycle for various application domains. I have engaged with different testing organizations gaining an all round view of testing. Within my projects, I strive to understand associated business requirements and technology-business integration needs. I have handled test project leadership, coordination, and reporting across multiple client organizations. 

My specialties in the context of testing: Exploratory testing, Project management, Documentation, Research and analysis, Process design and re-engineering, Requirements elicitation and verification.

My testing ‚öíÔ∏è : Taking immense quantities of screenshots, obsessively combing through back-end logs and timestamps, and have worked with JavaScript + Playwright, Java + Selenium, Git, Postman, and Python + Robot Framework.

Here is a poem I wrote while working from home during the pandemic of 2020:

It was actually inspired by a stack trace of an error I saw at the terminal:
